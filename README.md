# ArtistApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.9.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build --prod --build-optimizer` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. The build will have following performance improvments

Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation: pre-compiles Angular component templates.
Production mode: deploys the production environment which enables production mode.
Bundling: concatenates your many application and library files into a few bundles.
Minification: removes excess whitespace, comments, and optional tokens.
Uglification: rewrites code to use short, cryptic variable and function names.
Dead code elimination: removes unreferenced modules and much unused code

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
